# WP-Markdown-Exporter
Trying to make a plugin to enable a method to export WordPress posts to Markdown files with front matter YAML. 
...also using this to tinker around with PHP, but the overall goal is to make something that will allow me to export something that GoBlog can ingest.

Pull requests are very welcome!
